# Impact - an app for analyzing uber's environmental impact and suggesting the best hybrid public-uber route. 

## Introduction

The Uber vs. Bus Environmental Impact Analyzer is an application that leverages Machine Learning (ML) to help users make eco-friendly transportation choices. It evaluates the environmental impact of choosing an Uber taxi versus taking public transportation (bus) for a specific trip. By considering factors such as distance, vehicle type, and emissions, the app provides recommendations on whether to use an Uber or a bus for a more sustainable travel option.

This project is built using the FastAPI framework for the backend, scikit-learn for ML modeling, and Flutter for the mobile app's user interface.
